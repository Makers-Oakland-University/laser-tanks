# Laser Tanks  

Laser tanks is an interactive game created by Makers @ OU. 
The game is played with 4 remote control tanks equipped with IR emitters and receivers that play laser tag. 
Work is in progress to create ESP32 based laser tanks that utilize custom PCBs that can also be modified for use in other projects.
